# Mage-Match
A game where you are placed in a room and must fight off all the other wizards inside the room. 

                                Plan
You will either have 3 types of attack or 3 characters with 1 attack that you choose in the menu.
5 levels of scaling difficulty, last level is a boss. (If possible maybe some platforming in between levels. 
You can survive 2 attacks and the third will kill.
Upon dying, you can respawn 2 more times before game over. 

                              Movesets:
1. Ice: A wall of ice (3 spikes) that can hit enemies and deal damage
2. Fire: A normal fireball shot.
3. Pulse: a circular explosion a certain distance from the player.

                      Mandatory all character moves:
Jump and double jump: Characters can jump two times. 
Cloak: Invulnerable for 1 second (cooldown of 3)


                              Enemies: 
1. Dunce: Takes 1 hit to kill, takes it like a champ (no avoiding). Shoots a slow moving rock attack that can be jumped over.
2. Thick Skull: Same as Dunce but takes 3 hits to kill and shoots  3 rock  burst.
3. Thunder Wizard: drops lightning from above player head, 1 shot kill, possibly on a higher platform to add challenge.
4. Ninja: Tosses shuriken and jumps over fireballs. 1 shot.
5. Runt: Rat type enemy that is too short for fireballs. Only damages by touching.  1 shot

                                Boss: 
Invulnerable for first bit (Made visible by gold color)
Uses attacks like Dunce Rocks, Ninja Shuriken. 
1 attack is beams of red that warned by a streak of black then white and does damage on red.
One sweep of red that can be dodged with cloak only

After that, he is down for 5 seconds. (If I find out how to get this done) If player gets boss to 50% before 5 seconds, he gets up and repeats this cycle but with twice the attacks. 
When killed, play vicotorius fanfare, and give an actual good ending screen that you click out of.
